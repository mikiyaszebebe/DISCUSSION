# Discussion Guide

Use this document to keep conversations organized, actionable, and easy to revisit.

## When to start a discussion
- You want feedback or brainstorming before creating an issue or PR.
- You need to document decisions, proposals, meeting notes, or RFCs.
- You have a question that is not yet a bug or feature request.

## How to start a thread
1) Pick the right category (e.g., Q&A, Ideas, RFC, Announcements).
2) Write a clear title with the scope and expected outcome.
3) In the body, include the context, options considered, and the ask.
4) Add links to relevant issues/PRs and artifacts (docs, designs, logs).

### Starter template
```
## Summary
Concise statement of the topic and goal.

## Context
Key facts, links, and constraints (who/what/why/when).

## Options
- Option A: pros/cons
- Option B: pros/cons

## Decision / Next Steps
- Owner: @username
- Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Actions: list the follow-up tasks or issues to open
```

## Reply etiquette
- Add evidence: links, code blocks, screenshots when useful.
- Keep one idea per comment; use bullets for readability.
- Call out blockers or risks early.
- If you change your mind, edit the latest summary comment to keep the thread current.

## Decision tracking
- Summarize the outcome in the top comment and mark it as the answer (or pin it).
- Create follow-up issues/PRs for actionable items and link back to the thread.
- If a proposal is rejected, record why to avoid repeating the debate.

## Meeting notes (if applicable)
- Post agendas before the meeting; capture notes in the thread during/after.
- Include attendees, decisions, and action items with owners and dates.

## Moderation
- Be respectful and assume positive intent.
- Keep discussions focused on the topic; start a new thread when scope drifts.
- Remove sensitive data; use sanitized excerpts for logs or screenshots.
